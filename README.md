# PMSM_Rotor_Temp_Prediction
Predicting Rotor Temperature of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor(PMSM) using a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)

The current notebook uses the electric-motor-temperature dataset to predict the rotor temperature of a motor.

The dataset and its description is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/wkirgsn/electric-motor-temperature

The goal of the project is to efficietly predict the rotor temperature of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), 
as it is usually difficult to measure the rotor temperature. This kind of prediction helps to reduce the amount of equipment
that is to be mounted on to the motor to measure the temperature.
